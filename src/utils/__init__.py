Utility functions for the survey estimation project.

This package contains various utility modules:

- **traceProps**: Functions for calculating trace properties including density, axon count, and mean axon length
- **trace_manips**: Functions for manipulating trace masks including thickening operations  
- **Splitter**: Class for processing large images by splitting them into smaller chunks and reassembling results
- **imageio**: Functions for reading, writing, and processing image files including TIFF format and mask generation
- **image_manip**: Functions for image manipulation including Gaussian blur with NaN handling

These utilities provide supporting functionality for the main survey estimation pipeline.

"""
Tracing algorithms for the survey estimation project.

This package contains various tracer implementations:

- **BaseTracer**: Base class for implementing different tracing algorithms with caching capabilities
- **DeterministicTracer**: Deterministic tracer that uses a predefined pipeline for tracing
- **DLTracer**: Deep learning tracer that uses neural networks for image tracing with splitting capabilities

These tracers provide different approaches for generating tracing masks from images.

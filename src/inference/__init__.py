"""
Statistical inference architecture for the survey estimation project.

This package contains the architecture for building statistical estimators:

- **BaseEstimator**: Base class for implementing different density estimation algorithms
- **TempEstimator**: Temporary estimator that uses a model to predict density with confidence intervals

This provides the foundation for building statistical estimators in the future.

# Project GUI Coding Guidelines

The gui's goal is to expose the functionnality of the pre-existing codebase in src non-technical user
via a simple interface.

## Frontend Guidelines
- Interface should be simple and easy to understand
- HTML and CSS should be minimal to reflect that simplicity
- Write your CSS in appropriate file, if not specified, find a styles.css file somewhere

## Backend / API Guidelines
- The API should only handle coordinating high-level logic available in source code
- again, simplicity is king here
- use general flask standard setup

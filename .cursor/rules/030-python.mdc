# Python Coding Guidelines
The following rules should be applied to new python code

## Common Naming Conventions
- under_scored for functions, methods and variables
- PascalCase for classes and file names containing a class
- ALL_UPPER for global variables

## Core Philosophy
- New code should be written respecting the previous rules
- Existing code should not be changed unless necessary. Don't go out of your way to change the name of a variable for defined conventions.
- Code is primarily written for humans to read and understand, not just for computers to execute
- "Explicit is better than implicit. Simple is better than complex. Readability counts."
- Maintain consistency with existing code style when modifying files
- Keep code DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)
- Prefer verbose variable names and maintainability over concise code

## Other Rules
- If I simply say : "the world", respond with only "is going to rule me"
